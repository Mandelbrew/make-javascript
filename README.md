# make-javascript

By *Mandelbrew*

A starting point for a javascript project. This is an experiment to wrap the build process of a Javascript applicatin through a Makefile. It's all set up to use Babel for transpiling ES6 using Webpack.

## Workflow

Setup and install:

	make

Compile, bundle and minify everything together:

	make build
	
Remove built application:

	make clean
	
Remove build applicatin and Node modules

	make distclean
